# fem-transient
The project is a solution for the classic FEM transient heat transfer process- shows the minimal and maximum temperature of the body in each step.  
For example, it shows how much time is needed to heat up a meal in the oven. It's only needed to know parameters like ambient temperature, conductivity, initial temperature, density, etc.
